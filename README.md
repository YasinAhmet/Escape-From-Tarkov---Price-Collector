# Escape-From-Tarkov---Price-Collector
A price collector for Tarkov-Market. Collects the item and it's price, finds out it's id from the item database of SPTarkov. Uses Selenium for the process.

Since there is potentially lots of bugs in the collector, it's IDE launch only.

You can lower 77. line's backspace amount to remove wrong item collection. That mechanism is to recognize items that is the same item with the searched one, but has a shorter name with the same words.
